Stability Analysis in Control Systems

Introduction
Stability is one of the most important characteristics of control systems. A stable system is one where the output remains bounded for any bounded input, and small disturbances do not cause the system to diverge.

Types of Stability

1. BIBO Stability (Bounded-Input Bounded-Output)
A system is BIBO stable if every bounded input produces a bounded output.

2. Asymptotic Stability
A system is asymptotically stable if its output approaches zero as time approaches infinity for any initial condition.

3. Marginal Stability
A system is marginally stable if bounded inputs produce bounded outputs, but the output does not approach zero.

Stability Criteria

1. Routh-Hurwitz Stability Criterion

The Routh-Hurwitz criterion is an algebraic method to determine stability without solving the characteristic equation.

Procedure:
Step 1: Write the characteristic equation: a₀s^n + a₁s^(n-1) + ... + aₙ = 0
Step 2: Form the Routh array
Step 3: Examine the first column of the Routh array

Stability Conditions:
- All elements in the first column must be positive
- Number of sign changes = number of roots in right half of s-plane
- No sign changes = stable system

Example Routh Array for 3rd order system:
s³ | a₀  a₂
s² | a₁  a₃
s¹ | b₁  0
s⁰ | c₁  0

Where:
b₁ = (a₁×a₂ - a₀×a₃) / a₁
c₁ = (b₁×a₃ - a₁×0) / b₁ = a₃

2. Root Locus Method

The root locus is a graphical method that shows how the closed-loop poles move in the s-plane as a system parameter (typically gain) varies.

Key Points:
- Poles on the left half of s-plane: stable
- Poles on the imaginary axis: marginally stable
- Poles on the right half of s-plane: unstable

Root Locus Rules:
1. Number of branches = number of poles
2. Locus starts at open-loop poles (K=0)
3. Locus ends at open-loop zeros (K=∞)
4. Locus is symmetrical about real axis
5. Breakaway and break-in points can be found by dK/ds = 0
6. Angle of asymptotes: θ = (2k+1)×180° / (n-m)
   Where n = number of poles, m = number of zeros

3. Nyquist Stability Criterion

The Nyquist criterion uses frequency response to determine stability of closed-loop systems.

Nyquist Stability Criterion:
Z = N + P

Where:
- Z = number of closed-loop poles in right half-plane
- P = number of open-loop poles in right half-plane
- N = number of clockwise encirclements of -1 point

Stability Condition:
- For stable closed-loop system: Z = 0
- Therefore: N = -P

Gain Margin (GM):
The amount of gain increase that can be tolerated before the system becomes unstable.
GM (dB) = 20×log₁₀(1/|G(jω)|) at phase crossover frequency

Phase Margin (PM):
The amount of additional phase lag that can be tolerated before instability.
PM = 180° + ∠G(jω) at gain crossover frequency

Typical Design Specifications:
- GM ≥ 6 dB
- PM ≥ 30° to 60°

4. Bode Plot Analysis

Bode plots show magnitude and phase of frequency response.

Advantages:
- Easy to sketch for complex systems
- Provides gain and phase margins directly
- Useful for controller design

Stability from Bode Plot:
- System is stable if at gain crossover frequency, phase margin is positive
- System is stable if at phase crossover frequency, gain margin is positive

State-Space Stability Analysis

For state-space representation:
ẋ = Ax + Bu
y = Cx + Du

Stability Criterion:
System is stable if all eigenvalues of matrix A have negative real parts.

Methods to find eigenvalues:
1. Solve det(sI - A) = 0
2. Use numerical computation tools

Lyapunov Stability Theory

Lyapunov's Direct Method:
If there exists a positive definite function V(x) such that:
1. V(0) = 0
2. V(x) > 0 for all x ≠ 0
3. dV/dt ≤ 0 along system trajectories

Then the system is stable.

If dV/dt < 0 (strictly negative), the system is asymptotically stable.

Relative Stability

Relative stability measures how far a system is from instability.

Measures of Relative Stability:
1. Gain Margin (GM)
2. Phase Margin (PM)
3. Resonant Peak (Mr)
4. Resonant frequency (ωr)
5. Bandwidth

Effects of System Parameters on Stability

1. Gain:
- Increasing gain can make stable system unstable
- Too low gain: slow response
- Too high gain: oscillations and instability

2. Time Delays:
- Increase phase lag
- Reduce phase margin
- Can destabilize systems

3. Poles Location:
- Dominant poles: closest to imaginary axis
- Affect transient response
- Closer to jω axis: slower response, less stable

4. Zeros:
- Can improve stability
- Affect overshoot and settling time

Stability Improvement Techniques

1. Compensation:
- Lead compensation: improves phase margin
- Lag compensation: improves steady-state accuracy
- Lag-lead compensation: combines both benefits

2. Feedback:
- Output feedback
- State feedback
- Derivative feedback

3. Feedforward:
- Reduces effect of known disturbances
- Improves tracking performance

4. Controller Design:
- PID tuning
- Pole placement
- LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator)
- H∞ control

Practical Considerations

1. Modeling Errors:
- Actual system may differ from model
- Design for robust stability
- Include safety margins

2. Nonlinearities:
- Saturation
- Dead zones
- Hysteresis
- May cause limit cycles

3. Disturbances:
- External disturbances affect stability
- Design for disturbance rejection
- Consider worst-case scenarios

4. Measurement Noise:
- Affects feedback signal
- Can excite high-frequency dynamics
- Use filtering appropriately

Common Stability Problems

1. Oscillations:
- Cause: Insufficient damping
- Solution: Reduce gain or add damping

2. Instability:
- Cause: Positive feedback, high gain
- Solution: Reduce gain, add compensation

3. Sluggish Response:
- Cause: Low gain, poor tuning
- Solution: Increase gain carefully

4. Steady-State Error:
- Cause: Insufficient integral action
- Solution: Add or increase integral gain
